## Plotting copy number profile for a single sample

We aim to plot the copy number profile for a single sample using the .rds file generated by the scAbsoltue. Firstly, we need to set up the environment.
For this, we can create the environment from [this yml file](envs/plotCopynumber.yml) and then activate it.

``` 
conda env create -f vignettes/envs/plotCopynumber.yml
conda activate plotCopynumber
``` 

In the next step, we can run the [run_plotCopynumber](scripts/run_plotCopynumber.R) script with two arguments.

``` 
Rscript run_plotCopynumber.R [Path to the scAbsolute] [Path to the rds object generated by scAbsolute]
``` 
We run scAbsolute for the [toy dataset] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1402zegR4H7tWFluc2el9lyUr9H8rMXX6?usp=sharing) and 
here is an example command for running [run_plotCopynumber](scripts/run_plotCopynumber.R) script on the results of this example.  

``` 
Rscript run_plotCopynumber.R ~/scAbsolute ~/results/500/individual/UID-10X-Fibroblast-cell_SLX-00000_000001_AAACCTGAGCAGCCTC-1.rds
``` 

In the end, a pdf file (Rplots.pdf) would be generated, which is including a plot of single cell copy number profile, chromosome and only CN profile.
